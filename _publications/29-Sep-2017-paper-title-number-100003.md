The current study aims to assign and estimate the total creatine (tCr) signal contribution to the Z-spectrum in mouse brain at 11.7 T. Creatine (Cr), phosphocreatine (PCr) and protein phantoms were used to confirm the presence of a guanidinium resonance at this field strength. Wild-type (WT) and knockout mice with guanidinoacetate N-methyltransferase deficiency (GAMT-/-), which have low Cr and PCr concentrations in the brain, were used to assign the tCr contribution to the Z-spectrum. To estimate the total guanidinium concentrations, two pools for the Z-spectrum around 2 ppm were assumed: (i) a Lorentzian function representing the guanidinium chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) at 1.95 ppm in the 11.7-T Z-spectrum; and (ii) a background signal that can be fitted by a polynomial function. Comparison between the WT and GAMT-/- mice provided strong evidence for three types of contribution to the peak in the Z-spectrum at 1.95 ppm, namely proteins, Cr and PCr, the latter fitted as tCr. A ratio of 20 ± 7% (protein) and 80 ± 7% tCr was found in brain at 2 μT and 2 s saturation. Based on phantom experiments, the tCr peak was estimated to consist of about 83 ± 5% Cr and 17 ± 5% PCr. Maps for tCr of mouse brain were generated based on the peak at 1.95 ppm after concentration calibration with in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

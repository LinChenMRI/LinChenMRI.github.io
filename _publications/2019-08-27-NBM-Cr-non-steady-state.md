The current study aims to optimize the acquisition scheme for the creatine (Cr) CEST-weighted (CrCESTw) signal on mouse brain at 11.7T, in which a strong magnetization transfer contrast (MTC) is present, and to further develop the Polynomial and Lorentzian Line-shape Fitting (PLOF) method for quantifying CrCESTw signal with non-steady-state (NSS) acquisition scheme. Studies on a Cr phantom with cross-linked bovine serum albumin (BSA) as well as on mouse brain demonstrated that the maximum CrCESTw signal was reached with a short saturation time determined by the rotating frame relaxation time of the MTC pool instead of the steady-state saturation. The saturation power for the maximal signal was around 1-1.5 uT for Cr with 20% cross-linked BSA and in vivo applications, but 2 µT was found to be most practical for signal stability.  For the CrCEST acquisition with strong MTC interference, the optimal saturation power and length are completely different from those on Cr solution alone. This observation could be well explained using the R_1ρ theory by incorporating the strong MTC pool. Finally, a high-resolution Cr map was obtained on mouse brain using the PLOF method with the NSS CEST acquisition and a cryogenic coil. The Cr map obtained by CEST showed homogenous intensity across the mouse brain except for regions with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

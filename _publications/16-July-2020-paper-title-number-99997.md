excerpt: '<b>The results indicate that the AD mice with tau pathology have smaller D-glucose uptake in the parenchyma and slower D-glucose uptake in CSF compared to their WT counterpart, which was tentatively attributed to reduced glucose transporter density or impaired transporter functioning at BBB and BCSFB of AD mice. The results also suggest that the DGE curve of CSF has the potential to be a non-invasive tool for assessing the glymphatic function in brain.</b><br><center><img width = "80%" src="http://linchenmri.github.io/files/2020-JCBFM-onVDMP-AD.png" alt=""></center>'

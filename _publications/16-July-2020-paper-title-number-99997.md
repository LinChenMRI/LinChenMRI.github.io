excerpt: "<b>The results indicate that the AD mice with tau pathology have smaller D-glucose uptake in the parenchyma and slower D-glucose uptake in CSF compared to their WT counterpart, which was tentatively attributed to reduced glucose transporter density or impaired transporter functioning at BBB and BCSFB of AD mice. The results also suggest that the DGE curve of CSF has the potential to be a non-invasive tool for assessing the glymphatic function in brain.</b><br><center><img width = "80%" src="http://linchenmri.github.io/files/2020-JCBFM-onVDMP-AD.png" alt=""></center>"

In this study, we applied on-resonance variable delay multiple pulse (onVDMP) MRI to study D-glucose uptake in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) tauopathy and demonstrated its feasibility in discriminating AD mice from wild-type mice. The D-glucose uptake in the cortex of AD mice (1.70 ± 1.33%) was significantly reduced compared to that of wild-type mice (5.42 ± 0.70%, p = 0.0051). Also, a slower D-glucose uptake rate was found in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of AD mice (0.08 ± 0.01 min<sup>−1</sup>) compared to their wild-type counterpart (0.56 ± 0.1 min<sup>−1</sup>, p < 0.001), which suggests the presence of an impaired glucose transporter on both blood–brain and blood–CSF barriers of these AD mice. Clearance of D-glucose was observed in the CSF of wild-type mice but not AD mice, which suggests dysfunction of the glymphatic system in the AD mice. The results in this study indicate that onVDMP MRI could be a cost-effective and widely available method for simultaneously evaluating glucose transporter and glymphatic function of AD. This study also suggests that tau protein affects the D-glucose uptake and glymphatic impairment in AD at a time point preceding neurofibrillary tangle pathology.

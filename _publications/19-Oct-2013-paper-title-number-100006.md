Compared to the echo planar imaging (EPI), spatiotemporally encoded (SPEN) single-shot MRI holds better immunity to the field inhomogeneity, while retaining comparable spatial and temporal resolutions after the super-resolved reconstruction. Though various reconstruction methods have been proposed, the reconstructed SPEN images usually contain aliasing artifacts because of vast undersampling. A hybrid scheme based on random sampling, singular value decomposition (SVD) and compressed sensing (CS) was introduced to reduce these aliasing artifacts and improve the image quality. The efficiency of this hybrid scheme was demonstrated by numerical simulations and experiments on water phantom and in vivo rat brain. The hybrid scheme provided herein would benefit the SPEN approach in vast undersampling situation.

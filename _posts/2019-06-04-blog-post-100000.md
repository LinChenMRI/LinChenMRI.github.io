The creatine kinase reaction provides energy for cells by reversibly regenerating adenosine triphosphate from a phosphocreatine pool. Functional impairment of this system is observed in many neurodegenerative and muscle diseases. In this study, we developed a high-resolution phosphocreatine (PCr) mapping approach that can be used on standard magnetic resonance clinical scanners by specifically detecting PCr via the water proton signal using a chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) method. An artificial neural network was employed to achieve absolute quantification of PCr concentration. Such a mapping method offers a non-invasive, rapid imaging tool to quantify abnormalities in PCr content and distribution in musculoskeletal diseases.

This vedio give a brief introduction about off-resonance VDMP, which can separate and quantify CEST signals based on exchange rates. This is different from a typical CEST experiment that targets a spectral frequency associated with a specific metabolite (e.g. creatine), or filters out “unwanted” contributions, such as those from macromolecules using their unique line-shapes. The VDMP approach can detect all contributions, as long as they exchange, and is not even limited to metabolites.
